# DiscordBot
Simple Discord Bot.

This bot gets data from a website and then posts it on a specific channel.
I used this simple bot to get news from the web.

# Setup
1. Create a .env file for the credentials. (The file should be in the same folder where are the other files)
2. Create a docker image.
3. Run the container.
